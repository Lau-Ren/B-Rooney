                      <p class="thumb-info">The initial idea was simple- document how Garage Projects cans are made at a factory in Auckland, New Zealand. Hops on Pointe was originally brewed for the Royal New Zealand Ballet, an elegant champagne pilsner. It quickly became clear that putting the machine's work to classical music was absolutely necessary. The original youtube video has 74,000+ views and was featured on several prominent food websites.</p>

Luckily at around the same time Wellington Phoenix player Paul Iffel was set to return to the team after a serious injury. Since Rembrandt sponsors the Phoenix, they had the idea to interview Paul about his career, his clothes, and life. Paul was a true class act on set, and helped us show off this new jacket in a way only he could.</p>

From Sophie: 'This film explores an idea that came out of the artists personal feelings surrounding light and darkness. By cocooning the wearer with a cover of soft mohair and stretch cotton, the textile diffuses the form of the wearer, covering the mouth and nose only allowing the eyes to be seen over the top. The textile becomes a mechanism of protection, of safety in a dark space.'</p>

             The initial idea was simple- document how Garage Projects cans are made at a factory in Auckland, New Zealand. Hops on Pointe was originally brewed for the Royal New Zealand Ballet, an elegant champagne pilsner. It quickly became clear that putting the machine's work to classical music was absolutely necessary. The original youtube video has 74,000+ views and was featured on several prominent food websites.
